Welcome to my personal portfolio website!!!

In this journey, I put my HTML/CSS/Javascript knowledge to the test and acquired a lot of fun experience along the way. My website is of no means a professional product but it was my way of dabbling into my interests in front-end development as well as giving myself an outlet to showcase my other personal projects.
